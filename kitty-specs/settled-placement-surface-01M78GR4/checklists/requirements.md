# Specification Quality Checklist: One placement surface after topology settlement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-12
**Mission**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — command names and artifact names are the user-facing surface of this CLI; module internals live in research/
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (operator-facing workflow terms only)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique and match the requirement-ID grammar
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Every FR row and success criterion carries a delivery label and no-op mark
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (C-006)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Mission Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Mission meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Brief-intake mode: the dispatch brief (sub-epic #7546) plus the operator's escalation rulings
  (decisions/) are the confirmed intent; research/ holds the grounding.
